# MyScoreBoard

A modern, mobile-friendly board game scorekeeper. Built with .NET 9 Blazor WebAssembly and a touch of flair. Tracks players, rounds, totals, history, and lets you pause/resume games with persistent storage in the browser.

## ‚ú® Features

- Quick game setup with saved defaults (game name + players)
- Round-based scoring with fast +/- adjustments and negative scores
- Automatic totals and leader/tie indicators
- Resume active game from Home (auto-saved in background)
- End-game winner modal with confetti celebration
- Game history with players, scores, and winners
- Clean, high-contrast, glassy UI tuned for mobile

## üß± Tech Stack

- Blazor WebAssembly (.NET 9)
- Bootstrap 5 styling (with custom glass theme)
- IndexedDB for durable storage (custom JS interop)
- localStorage for quick flags and preferences
 - sqlite-net-pcl for local persistence on MAUI
 - Shared models and service interfaces in `MyScoreBoardShared` to enable code sharing between Blazor and MAUI

## üíæ Data Persistence

Web (Blazor) persistence
- Active games are saved to the `active` store in IndexedDB (via `wwwroot/js/indexedDb.js`).
- Completed games are appended to the `games` store.
- A quick `hasActiveGame` boolean is mirrored in `localStorage` for snappy UI.
- The web `IndexedDbService` wraps JS interop and exposes async store helpers.

MAUI persistence
- MAUI platforms use `sqlite-net-pcl` and a sqlite-backed `IndexedDbService` implementation that persists `GameStoreEntry` records in a local database file (`myscoreboard.db3`).
- `ILocalStorageService` on MAUI is implemented with `Preferences` for quick flags.

Shared architecture
- Models (Player, Round, GameSession, GameStoreEntry) live in `MyScoreBoardShared/Models` so both apps share types.
- Service interfaces (`IGameService`, `IIndexedDbService`, `ILocalStorageService`) live in `MyScoreBoardShared/Services`.
- The Blazor app registers JS-backed services; the MAUI app registers platform-backed implementations; both consume the shared interfaces via DI.

If you ever hit an IndexedDB schema issue in dev:
- Clear site data or delete the `myscoreboard` DB (Application tab ‚Üí IndexedDB), then refresh.

## üß≠ Usage Tips

- Tap a player card to add a score (+/- quick buttons included)
- The Next Round button enables once all players have scored this round
- End Game to see the winner popup and confetti, then return Home
- History cards show top players and final scores; delete any entry as needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- "Resume" button not showing:
  - Home checks `localStorage` first, then verifies IndexedDB in the background
  - Start a game in Setup to create an active session
- IndexedDB errors after refactor:
  - We version and recreate the `active` object store when needed
  - If something looks stale, clear the site data and refresh
- Hamburger not opening on mobile:
  - We include `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` and use `navbar-dark` with white icon
